# week2DataChallenge
This set of tutorials supports health association analysis using UK Biobank accelerometry data.

The webpage contains all the tutorials. 

To run all the analyses here, you will need to use some functions in this package. This repository is structured as an R package, so the easiest way to use these functions is to install and load the package: 
```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("activityMonitoring/week2DataChallenge")
library(week2DataChallenge)
```

Alternatively, you can download and run the script `R/utils.R` in your R session.
