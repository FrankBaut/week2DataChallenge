# Using RStudio on the VM
To run RStudio on your VM, follow the instructions on [this page](https://canvas.ox.ac.uk/courses/66998/pages/your-hds-virtual-machine/). 

In brief, log in to the VM, and run:
```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
module load rstudio/1.2.5033-fosscuda-2019b-Java-11
/apps/misc/rserver.sh
```
Then follow the on-screen instructions to set up an ssh tunnel by running something like the following locally (numbers and username may differ):
```
ssh -L 8787:localhost:8787 username@vm.bmrc.ox.ac.uk
```
Finally, navigate to http://localhost:8787 in your browser. 


# Using functions
To run all the analyses here, you will need to use some functions in this R package. This repository is structured as an R package, so the easiest way to use these functions is to install and load the package:

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("activityMonitoring/week2DataChallenge")
library(week2DataChallenge)
```
Alternatively, you can download and run the script R/utils.R in your R session.
